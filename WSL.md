### WSL Developement

Build/run the app via [WSLG](https://github.com/microsoft/wslg).
```
make && make test
```

#### WSL Gotcha

When first trying to compile it I ran out of memory so I had to add this to my `%USERPROFILE%/.wslconfig`

```
# Settings apply across all Linux distros running on WSL 2
[wsl2]

# Limits VM memory to use no more than 4 GB, this can be set as whole numbers using GB or MB
memory=20GB 

# Sets the VM to use two virtual processors
processors=8

# Sets amount of swap storage space to 8GB, default is 25% of available RAM
swap=8GB
```

It also still took me around an hour to compile for the first time ðŸ˜‚. Then after that with the `--install` flag it takes around a couple of mins.
